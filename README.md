<p style="text-align:center;">
The application displays updated today's weather data based on the user's location, including the current conditions and temperature in Celsius. To achieve this, the app requires an active internet connection. 
Additionally, the application provides a weather forecast for the user's location, showing the expected temperature and conditions, such as whether it will be rainy or sunny. The app allows users to add cities to display weather data. However, some places and cities may be excluded, with a focus on including main cities, like capitals.

<h2 style="text-align:center;">Purpose</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;">
The primary reason behind creating this app is to put into practice the knowledge and skills I have accumulated over the years, 
However This application will be in bigger project in the future and maybe more optimized and overhauled.

<h2 style="text-align:center;">Features</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;">
I created a search that will display the cities according to user's search input, on the click of an add button the city will add to the left sidebar on the application.

That's the search after clicking on the search button:

Additionally, I have included a table of contents of the condition symbols that will display to the user the corresponding symbols representing the weather's data.
